## Galway Adventure Website

### **About The Project**
This is a website I created for a fictional outdoor adventure company. The website was built using the Bootstrap5 framework. I used XAMPP and phpMyAdmin to locally host the website and pricing database while building the website. All artwork / logos were created by me for the project.
